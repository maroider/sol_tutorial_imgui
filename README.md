# An attempt to follow a tutorial about immediate mode user interfaces in Rust

The tutorial in question can be found [here](http://sol.gfxile.net/imgui/).

This repository currenlty contains mostly correct code up to and including chapter 06.

Currently missing things from previous chapters includes:
 * Selecting a random background color when the third buton is pressed.
 * Variable-range scroll bars
